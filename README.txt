medialog.tvedttheme
=======================

A theme intended for use with mobile theming control panel (zettwerk.mobiletheming).
The theme uses plone.app.themingplugins to override templates just for this theme.
These templates will not work if you duplicate the theme TTW (themingplugins do not work for that)

Usage
======
You probably want to use the theme like this:

- install zettewerk.mobiletheming

- install medialog.tvedttheme

- go to the mobile theming control panel and choose which url that should have the mobile theme.

- It is of course possible to enable the theme in diazo theme control panel and use it as a regular theme


When you want to edit the theme, you should do this on the file system.
If you duplicate it TTW, the overridden templates will not be used.
